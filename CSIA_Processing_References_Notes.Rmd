# Steps (possibly)

1.  Blank correction (?)
2.  Correlation of reference to measured $\delta$15N. Not sure how to do this though, since derivatization changes it. So maybe the drift correction step takes this place.
3.  Do your little drift correction
4.  QA/QC measures? (can maybe use some of the steps from @welicky2021)
    1.  @feddern2022 includes in the supp info a table of mean standard deviation (so over multiple runs) for each AA
    2. @welicky2021 had a table of mean, median, and max stdev

# Notes from other references

1.  @ohkouchi2017 "Detection limits to achieve this level of precision and accuracy depend on various factors, but they are highly correlated with the signal/noise ratio of the GC-IRMS chromatogram"
